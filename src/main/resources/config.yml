checks:

#
# AutoClick
#
# Caps clicks per second (CPS) at a hard limit, also calculates
# the variance in the user's clicks (constancy) and the variance
# in the variance (constancy super).
#
# Performance impact: Minimal
# Effectiveness: untested
#
  autoclick:
      # Clicks older than this are completely ignored
    total-retention-secs: 32
    # A basic CPS cap
    hard-limit:
      # These are pairs of CPS limits and required time spans
      #
      # If the player's CPS measured over the time span is greater than the CPS limit, a violation is triggered.
      #
      # For example, '16:3' means that if the player's clicks in the past 3 seconds average 16 CPS, trigger a violation.
      cps-and-required-span:
        - '35:2'
    # A more advanced consistency check
    constancy:
      # These are pairs of standard deviation percentages and sample counts
      #
      # The standard deviation is calculated based on the interval between clicks in the sample.
      # The second number in the pair determines the sample size.
      # Then, the standard deviation percentage is calculated as the standard deviation as percent of the average.
      # If this percent is less than the first number in the pair, a violation is triggered.
      #
      # For example, '30:8' means that if the standard deviation in the interval between clicks over a sample
      # of 8 intervals, divided by the average interval, is greater than 30%, trigger a violation.
      deviation-and-sample:
        - '30:10'
      # These are pairs of standard deviation percentages and sample counts
      #
      # These are conceptually similar to the previous. However, this measures the standard deviations between
      # the standard deviations. Thus, it is called the "super deviation".

        - '60:10'
