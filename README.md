# NESS-Reloaded
NESS Anti-Cheat reloaded is a recoded version of the old NESS, developed by MSWS.
This anticheat aims to support lots of minecraft versions (from 1.8 to 1.16.5) without losing the advantage of having powerful checks.

Although tested on Spigot, NESS Reloaded should work with most forks.

NESS Reloaded has an experimental support for GeyserMC even if you will get some false flags. In this case I suggest to report them.
